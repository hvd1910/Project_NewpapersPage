          <span>When the fighting broke out, the Ukrainian regular troops in Sumy were ordered to withdraw, forcing the civilians 
            here to take up arms and fight to protect the city.</span>
            <br><br>
            
            <span>When nearly 200,000 Russian troops entered Ukraine in the early morning of February 24, 2022, the defense force of 
              the city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine, about 30 km from the Russian border, had only about 50 regular paratroopers 
              stationed. army and does not have a specific operational headquarters.</span>
              <br><br>
            <span>The first clash broke out outside the art college on the outskirts of the city. A formation of Russian tanks then 
              approached the school, where Ukrainian paratroopers were defending.</span>
              <br><br>
            <span>At first, both sides did not recognize each other, Russian soldiers even got out of the car and approached to ask 
              for directions, Ihor, 29, a member of the Sumy city council, said.</span>
              <br><br>
              <span>After a moment of surprise, the Ukrainian paratroopers reacted first, immediately opened fire at close range, destroying
                 the Russian tank and armored convoy. Ihor says this battle was one of the main factors that helped the city maintain its
                  defenses in the days that followed.</span>

          <div class="paper1-span">
            <span>By the evening of February 24, most of the police force and city leaders had withdrawn from Sumy. The 
              paratroopers also received orders to march to another location to preserve their forces, but their 
              battle led the Russian forces to believe that the regular Ukrainian army was present and defending the city
               with great force.</span>
               <br><br>
            <span>When the entire regular force withdrew, the people of Sumy were shocked and confused, but soon formed 
              a militia to defend the city.</span>
              <br><br>
            <span>Ihor and his friend Serhiy were among the 400 Sumyians who took up arms on the first day of hostilities, 
              though only 20 of these had military experience. They set up groups to patrol the streets in cars and trucks, 
              coordinating actions through phones and messaging apps. Many other civilians joined the militia a few days later.</span>
              <br><br>
            <span>"Formally, our group is called a territorial defense force, but in reality it is just civilians who receive 
              weapons from an armory, then split up to form resistance groups," Ihor said. tell. "The situation was very chaotic 
              at first, we received no instructions from Kiev and had to act on our own."</span>
              <br><br>
            <span>Ihor and Serhiy said the militia had some hand-held anti-tank weapons, with the rest armed only with personal 
              rifles and homemade petrol bombs. Both do not have bulletproof armor or other basic equipment.</span>

              are now joining the regular Ukrainian army. Photo: Guardian.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="paper1-span">
            <span>Even so, a large number of Sumyians participated in supporting the militia. While college girls make 
              petrol bombs, many older women are willing to text them the location of Russian forces, Serhiy said.</span>
              <br><br>
            <span>"We got lucky when the Russian forces thought that a large number of regular troops were defending the 
              city," Serhiy said. "Thanks to that, the city was able to cope."</span>
              <br><br>
            <span>During the first few days, Russian forces mainly conducted reconnaissance, sending small groups into the 
              city. The self-defense team knew every corner of the city and began to organize an ambush, with the main task
               of destroying fuel tankers, making Russian tanks and armored vehicles run out of gas and unable to move.</span>
               <br><br>
            <span>Such ambushes made Russian forces nervous as they entered the city. On March 16, Ukraine's intelligence service
               released an audio recording of a intercepted Russian soldier's communications, in which he said that "any convoy 
               entering Sumy will be destroyed".</span>
               <br><br>
            <span>Russia then gave up on entering the city and set up checkpoints, besieging Sumy. Despite the siege, 
              the Sumyian militia continued to resist and defend the city for the next six weeks.</span>

            <span>Resistance efforts by self-defense forces as well as civilians inside and outside the city 
              contributed to the disruption of Russia's supply routes from the border to Kiev, hindering 
              Russia's plan to encircle the Ukrainian capital.</span>
              <br><br>
            <span>On April 6, 2022, Russian forces left Sumy, when Russia announced the end of the first phase
               of the campaign and withdrew its troops to the Donbass region. Most of the Sumy militia members 
               later joined the army.</span>
               <br><br>
            <span>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly praised the force. In his New Year's Eve 
              speech on December 31, he honored Sumy's efforts to resist, describing how ordinary people defended 
              the city against the advancing Russian forces, even without tanks or armor. or heavy weapons.</span>
              <br><br>
            <span>Russia has not commented on Mr. Zelensky's comments about the resistance effort in the city of Sumy.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>Major General Oleksandr Nesterenko, who participated in the defensive campaign in Kiev and Kharkov, and is 
              now in charge of the defense forces in Sumy, said that as the fighting drags on, Russian forces may find a way 
              to enter the city again. , but "they will surely fail".</span>
              <br><br>
            <span>"These people at the beginning of the year were accountants and businessmen, but now they have become real
               warriors after nine months of training and participating in real combat," he said. 
               "We now have more manpower, more weapons and more motivation. Things won't be the same in February."</span>
