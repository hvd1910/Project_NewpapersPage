          <span>Through the audit in Ho Chi Minh City, based on the data at 31/7/2022, it was determined that the 
            excess source of salary reform in districts and districts is nearly VND 2,000 billion, not timely 
            recovering the source of 10% savings of the estimating units.</span>

            <span>Auditing the local budget in 2021 in Ho Chi Minh City, the State Audit of Region IV has proposed to 
            handle finance of VND 3,294 billion (Illustration).</span>
          </div>
          <div class="paper1-span">
            <span>In addition, the IA also pointed out many shortcomings and limitations in budget revenues and basic 
                construction investment expenditures of Ho Chi Minh City. Notably, in terms of compliance with the Law 
                and the collection regime at tax payers, the results of inspection and comparison of 281 enterprises 
                have: 239 enterprises with errors and untimely in complying with tax declaration and payment.</span><br><br>
            <span>The IA identified and proposed to increase state budget revenue by VND 276.5 billion, reduce input 
                VAT deducted by VND 23.9 billion, reduce the declared enterprise loss of VND 556.6 billion; 26 
                enterprises showed signs of improper tax declaration. In addition, there are 9 enterprises that 
                do not provide sufficient documents for tax reconciliation in violation of Article 68 of the Law 
                on IA, 2 enterprises that have petroleum trading activities but do not have business licenses as 
                prescribed.</span><br><br>
            <span>Through reviewing the declaration dossier of 30% reduction in corporate income tax (CIT) under 
                Decree No. 92 of the Government, there are 352 enterprises declaring incorrectly subjects to be 
                reduced according to regulations, the amount of CIT payable is an additional 7.7 billion VND.</span><br>

            <span>Resolution 128 has instructed agencies and localities to create sources of wage reform</span>
          </div>
          <div class="paper1-span">
            <span>According to the KTNN, the regular spending of Ho Chi Minh City still has many shortcomings that 
                need to be overcome. Specifically, in the field of budget, the District People's Committee is an estimating 
                unit under the City People's Committee, leading to the failure to ensure timely funding for the implementation 
                of urgent tasks, national defense, security, prevention, prevention and recovery of natural disasters, 
                epidemics and unexpected tasks in the area (due to the absence of local budget surpluses).</span><br><br>
            <span>In the implementation of the specific financial mechanism according to Resolution 54/2017/QH14 of the National 
                Assembly, up to now, some contents have been implemented slowly compared to the plan, not achieving the set goals. 
                According to the audit agency, in the condition that the city has implemented the organization of urban government, 
                it is necessary to continue to propose to the National Assembly to promulgate a new resolution in accordance with 
                the urban government mechanism, and at the same time have solutions and research to maximize mechanisms and 
                policies such as: Decentralize management of a number of areas of investment management, budget finance; 
                economic management; specific mechanisms and policies for the development of Thu Duc City...</span><br><br>
            <span>It is worth noting that in terms of wage reform (CCTL), the 2021 budget still exists. Specifically, 
                the city assigns estimates to estimating units and districts to balance recurrent expenditures 
                (base salary difference of VND 280,000) and income increase according to Resolution 03/2018/NQ-HDND 
                not in order of priority of funding sources as prescribed.</span><br><br>
            <span>Through the audit, based on the data at 31/7/2022, it is determined that the excess supply of 
                cctl sources of districts and districts (after excluding the source used to increase income according to 
                Resolution No. 04 of the City People's Council in 2022 and the number of IAs proposed the previous year) 
                is VND 1,938 billion; have not timely recovered 10% of savings of budget estimating units at all levels 
                as prescribed in Circular No. 109 of the Ministry of Finance; the balance of cctl sources from state 
                budgets of city departments and sectors must recover VND 184.4 billion, because the budget has not been 
                fully adjusted to reduce cctl sources as prescribed.</span><br>
          </div>

          <div class="paper1-span">
            <span>According to budget revenue and expenditure data up to July 31, 2021, there are 10 districts and 
                districts with budget revenue shortfalls, but the city budget has not allocated enough funds for 
                COVID-19 prevention and control of districts due to some spending regimes not ensuring sufficient 
                funding facilities, however, the People's Committees of districts and wards have not submitted to 
                competent authorities appropriate financial handling plans as prescribed.</span><br><br>
